{synopt:{opt treat:ment(dummy)}}  			specifies the treatment dummy. , ie the dummy variable that takes value 1 if the observation belongs to the treatment group, and 0 otherwise. This is a compulsory option. {p_end}

{synopt:{opt output:file(filename)}}   		saves the table to file {it:filename}. This is a compulsory option. {p_end}

{synopt:{opt pw:eight(variable)}}   		specifies the variable that indicates probability weights.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt psu:clusterunit(variable)}}   	specifies the variable by which to cluster the t tests. This is the primary sampling unit. {p_end}


{syntab:Options}

{synopt:{opt str:ata(variable)}}			specifies the variable that indicates the sampling strata.

{synopt:{opt 2as:ter}}   				specifies to use two-aster notation instead of the default three-aster notation.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt browse:}}   				displays the summary stats in a browse table before proceeding.

{synopt:{opt replace:}}  				replaces the existing output tables with newly computed tables.

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:iesummarystats} calculates summary statistics and t-tests for equality of means of variables in {varlist} between treatment and comparison group. This command was designed for use in impact evaluation applications. 
{cmd:Important note} : you HAVE TO specify clustering and pweights!



{title:Explanation}

{dlgtab:Interpretation of the output table}

{phang}
{cmd:line} specifies a line number for the variables.

{phang}
{cmd:variablename} specifies the name of the variable.

{phang}
{cmd:nobscontrol} specifies the number of observations in the control group for that variable.

{phang}
{cmd:meancontrol} specifies the estimated mean in the control group for that variable.

{phang}
{cmd:errorcontrol} specifies the standard error of the mean in the control group for that variable.

{phang}
{cmd:nobstreatment} specifies the number of observations in the treatment group for that variable.

{phang}
{cmd:meantreatment} specifies the mean in the treatment group for that variable.

{phang}
{cmd:errortreatment} specifies the standard error of the mean in the control group for that variable.

{phang}
{cmd:difference} specifies the difference between the treatment group and the control group for that variable.

{phang}
{cmd:tstat} specifies the t-stat for the test of equality of means between the treatment and the control group, under the clustering specified in the command.

{phang}
{cmd:stars} specifies the number of stars corresponding to the two-sided t-test.
